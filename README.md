# FFMPEG Tools

Convert* and Encode * are drag and drop programs (drag a file on it to convert or encode it in the same directory as the source)


 ALL-2* are batch encoders. Put everything in ORIGINAL folder and it will encode to OUTPUT folder

 You must have ffmpeg compiled with correct libraries in your Windows PATH folder. If you don't, there is a choco installer for ffmpeg-full in the repo.
